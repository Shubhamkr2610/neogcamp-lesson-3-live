       <h1> Programming Languages </h1> 
       Language is a mode of communication that is used to share ideas, opinions with each other. For example, if we want to teach someone, we need a language that is understandable by both communicators.

       As we know, to communicate with a person, we need a specific language, similarly to communicate with computers, programmers also need a language is called Programming language.

       A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.



       Here are a couple of programming languages you could tackle :

<h1 class="hero-heading"> C :-<span class="heading-inverted">  </span></h1>  

Let’s start off with one of the most established programming languages still used today, C. It’s also a highly influential language, making it a useful one to know the basics of. 

C is a versatile language that has uses in many different areas. It’s mainly used for creating system applications, meaning that operating systems such as Windows and Linux use a lot of C programming. You can also use C to create games, graphics, and apps that use lots of calculations. 


<h1 class="hero-heading">Python :-<span class="heading-inverted">  </span></h1>  
Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language launched in 1992. It’s built in such a way that it’s relatively intuitive to write and understand, making it ideal for those who want rapid development. 

Python has many applications. As well as being good for general use, such as for web applications, it also has many areas of specialisation. A good example of the latter is for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. 

<h1 class="hero-heading"> SQL :-<span class="heading-inverted">  </span></h1>

If you’re interested in areas like database management, SQL is a language that you simply have to know. In fact, most developers need to have at least a basic knowledge of the language. 

Structured Query Language (SQL, sometimes called Sequel), is a domain-specific language designed for managing data held in databases. Unlike many of the different programming languages mentioned so far, this isn’t a general-purpose one, meaning its use is far narrower. 

<h1 class="hero-heading">JavaScript :-<span class="heading-inverted">  </span></h1>
Despite its name, JavaScript isn’t directly related to Java. However, it does use a Java-like syntax, which is where the name comes from. If you’re interested in client-side web browser coding, this is a language you want to learn.  

JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented programming language (although that second point is up for some debate). The language was created in the early days of the internet, back in 1995. You’ll find that all major web browsers have JavaScript support. 

As mentioned, JavaScript is a language used to write code that runs in web browsers. As such, it has a wide range of applications and is especially useful for making web pages interactive and responsive. It’s often used alongside HTML and CSS to add things like animations, video players, and even browser-based games. 


If you are not really into a programming language, don't despair! The programming world offers a variety of other subjects for you to consider.

Tightly linked to programming you'll find databases and a big data analysis, both subjects of immense interest in the IT community.
