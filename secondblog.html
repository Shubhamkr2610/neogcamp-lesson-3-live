       <h1> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES </h1> 

Yes, you'd have to actually know something about this. Whatever you know, even if it's about the easiest language, show people how and where you use this language. I'm sure there are people out there that will be blown away by you.

Here are a couple of programming languages you could tackle in your programming blog articles:

<h1 class="hero-heading">PHP:-<span class="heading-inverted">  </span></h1>  this is a general-purpose scripting language known for its steep learning curve. It is very beginner-friendly, and on top of that it backs a large chunk of all the website out there (does WordPress sounds familiar?) 

<h1 class="hero-heading">Python:-<span class="heading-inverted">  </span></h1>  certainly this one is considered a more “grown-up” programming language than the above-mentioned PHP. It is fairly popular hence its usage in web-development. Furthermore, it is one of the popular choices across universities. This is because of the language friendliness when it comes to mathematical algorithms and machine learning.

<h1 class="hero-heading">JavaScript + CSS + HTML:-<span class="heading-inverted">  </span></h1>
  This is the “holy trinity” of the front-end development. You can't go wrong with topics such as these since all programmers need to know about these technologies to some extent. Due to their massive popularity, there is an entire community dedicated to improving the front end space, while also a large number of potential newbies are joining in each day. Therefore, you'll have both new topics and new potential readers on a regular basis. Big win!

If you are not really into a programming language, don't despair! The programming world offers a variety of other subjects for you to consider.

Tightly linked to programming you'll find databases and a big data analysis, both subjects of immense interest in the IT community. Of course that all your Facebook Messages and Snapchat Pictures have to be stored somewhere. Furthermore, all this data has to be analyzed and computed in order for the companies to be able to deliver you the best ads possible.

In all seriousness, data is a big subject you should consider for your tech blog since it will reveal an entirely new target audience which is always interested in finding what's new in this space.
