                    <h1>Documenting my WEB-DEV journey.</h1>

                    <h3>Recently I kickstarted my exciting web development journey. Below is a blog about the experiences I had. This blog might help anyone looking for entering into web development journey.</h3>

                    I was in third year of bca. I was pursuing  bca but even after coming in third year I didn't know anything about coding so I also felt sometimes that I am studying just to get degree. Anyway, due to 2 years of covid, nothing could be studied because the colleges were running closed. In online studies, I did not know that there was any interaction with the teacher that I could learn more productively, just to pass the exam, the syllabus was being completed in the online classes.

                
                    I even don't know that  a 15 minute of casual conversation with one of  my school friend has
                    changed my life completely .
                    He was also studying bca.  After talking to him I realized that I am studying in computer field but I don't know anything as much as he knows about computer field. I learned a lot from him during our talks.


                    We shared our social media connections with each other
                    
                    This was the moment that change everything in my life  when he asked me about LinkedIn Connections then he surprised to know that i am not using linkedin despite of being from cs background .
                    

                    he told me everything about linkedin  that how useful linkedin is for a CS backgound students  then i created my linkedin  account. randomly   i found tanay sir and i checked his bio and about's him  and  its like blast  moment for me when i knew about tanay sir's neog boot camp . 

                    i read everyting about neog and i also decided to start prepartion for LEVEL 0

                    </header>

                    
                    I got to know how students with humble backgrounds, low tier colleges and even non CS-people are getting into webdev following this camp. Further I also saw students projects on Github and linkedIn seeing which really made me curious about how these technologies worried? So finally I decided that this is the best time to dip my feets into the world of web development.

                    I learned how HTML is the basic skeleton of a website and CSS is the decoration over it. Understood really closely about how a website works with Javascript. Seen how the websites are hosted on a server from which it is served to end users to be accessed anytime anywhere. The CSS were confusing at the beginning, aligning to center was something which took time for me. But eventually I got the trick by doing some experiments and following the DOM from the Chrome dev tools. VS Code feels so lightweight and snappy but I was not satisfied with itâ€™s auto-complete. This is maybe because JS is a dynamically typed language?

                    Overall I am very happy by starting the web dev. Now I feel really confident after having a portfolio, after having 5-6 apps on my github. 
                    <p>

                    Special thanks to Tanay sir at Microsoft for giving equal opportunity to everybody.
