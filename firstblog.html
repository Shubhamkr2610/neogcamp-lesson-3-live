                    </p>

                    <p> We will discuss some tips to learn programming effectively and faster. </p>

                    <h2 class="hero-heading"> 1. Start with the Basics:<span class="heading-inverted"> </span></h2>
                    It’s crucial for you to learn the basics first in any programming language. It will get much simpler
                    to learn the programming language once you understand the fundamentals correctly.

                    <h2 class="hero-heading"> 2. Find a Programming Buddy:<span class="heading-inverted"> </span></h2>
                    Having a companion who has common coding ambitions is one of the best ways to practice programming
                    and coding. You can either reach out to your neighborhood, office mates, or college friends, or you
                    can use online groups to find buddies.

                    <h2 class="hero-heading"> 3. Code by Hand: <span class="heading-inverted"> </span></h2>
                    If you ever want to study programming languages to a fundamental degree, the only successful way to
                    go is to write codes by hand.

                    <h2 class="hero-heading"> 4. Learn by Practicing: <span class="heading-inverted"> </span></h2>
                    You’ll find a lot of free online programs, videos, guides, etc. to learn how to code, but you’ll
                    only be able to code once you really start doing it. You can use free programming sites to educate
                    yourself and even use their educational software to start coding.

                    <h2 class="hero-heading"> 5. Look for as Many Courses as You Can:<span class="heading-inverted">
                        </span></h2>
                    One platform will teach you something, and other platforms will teach you a few other coding
                    talents, so when you start out, make sure you spend your time searching for as many courses as you
                    can.
